There are no academic \"talking heads\" here to spell out an official version of history; the narration, delivered with wonderful gravitas by Sir Laurence Olivier, is kept to a minimum. The show's great coup was to allow the participants to speak for themselves. Painstaking research in the archives of the Imperial War Museum also unearthed a vast quantity of newsreel footage, including on occasion the cameraman's original raw rushes which present an unvarnished and never-before-seen picture of important events.

From their very first day on the job, these rookies are plunged into the world of big city policing, a world where even the smallest mistake can have life-or-death consequences and serious emotional fall-out. The soul of this close-knit group is 26-year-old perfectionist Andy McNally. Honest to a fault, all Andy has ever wanted to be is \"good police.\" Her father was a cop, and while he wasn't the best cop – or the best father – Andy knows she'll never find this sense of family, loyalty and excitement in any other job. The series explores the trials, triumphs, competition and camaraderie of Andy and her rookie family – boyfriends, best friends, mentors and competitors – who are about to learn that no amount of training can prepare them for life.

Rome is ambitious, wealthy and ruthless as it grows into the most powerful empire the world had ever known. But to achieve total domination, it blankets the ancient world in blood and tyranny, igniting the barbarian rebellions that will ultimately lead to its downfall. This is not a story about the glory of Rome. It’s the story of the people who rise to fight for freedom against a cruel and violent force bent on their destruction. As Rome grows stronger, the barbarians are taxed, enslaved, slaughtered, displaced and robbed of their cultures. But set against seemingly overwhelming odds, they never surrender; evolving and innovating new ways to fight against an organized and determined enemy. This is a clash of titans fought over centuries. Barbarians Rising tells the epic saga of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire from the perspective of the barbarian leaders who brought it down; a high-impact, visceral journey into the heart of their rebellions against absolute power. The Roman Empire called them “barbarians” – tribes beyond the fringe of civilization that live a primitive, savage existence. But they are also some of the fiercest warriors in history – men and women who rose up to resist so that they might live free, or die. The four-part docu-drama reveals the true story of the 700-year battle for supremacy, a fight for freedom that would shape the world to come. Featuring fully dramatized portrayals of icons including Hannibal, Spartacus, Arminius, Boudica and Attila alongside an eclectic group of experts and contributors, Barbarians Rising reveals the true history behind the legends.","first_aired":"2016-06-07T00:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Monday","time":"20:00","timezone":"Europe/London"},"runtime":60,"certification":"TV-MA","network":"History","country":null,"trailer":null,"status":"returning series","rating":7.5,"votes":28,"language":"en","genres":["action","adventure","documentary"],"trakt_id":107671,"tvdb_id":311669,"tmdb_id":66641,"name":"Barbarians Rising","poster":null},{"year":2016,"overview":"Shimazu Toyohisa, while involved at the Battle of Sekigahara, manages to mortally wound Ii Naomasa, but is critically wounded in the process.

Two complete strangers -- a man and a woman -- meet in a very unique way: They're stranded in a dangerous, desolate location, without food and water, and they're completely naked. Each episode follows the two as they attempt to survive on their own for 21 days, with nothing but one personal item each and the knowledge that the only prize is their pride and sense of accomplishment. Because there is no other choice, the couple quickly get to know each other -- and their surroundings -- and hope that their instincts, survival skills and intestinal fortitude will serve them well.","first_aired":"2014-08-29T02:00:00.000Z","airs":{"day":"Sunday","time":"22:00","timezone":"America/New_York"},"runtime":42,"certification":"TV-14","network":"Discovery","country":"us","trailer":null,"status":"returning series","rating":6.44015,"votes":259,"language":"en","genres":["reality"],"trakt_id":58445,"tvdb_id":270693,"tmdb_id":58832,"name":"Naked and Afraid","poster":"http://assets.fanart.tv/preview/tv/270693/hdtvlogo/naked-and-afraid-51e1c483613ae.png"},{"year":2013,"overview":"Accompanied by haunting memories of his service time in World War II, Dr Lucian Blake returns home to Australia after 30 years to take over his deceased father's medical practice.
