The finale episode, \\\"The Parting of the Ways\\\", was broadcast on 18 June 2005. The show was revived by long time Doctor Who fan Russell T Davies, who had been lobbying the BBC since the late-90s to bring the show back. The first series comprised 13 episodes, eight of which Davies wrote. Davies, Julie Gardner and Mal Young served as executive producers, Phil Collinson as producer.\\n\\nThe show depicts the adventures of a mysterious and eccentric Time Lord known as the Doctor, who travels through time and space in his time machine, the TARDIS, which normally appears from the exterior to be a blue 1950s British police box. With his companions, he explores time and space, faces a variety of foes and saves civilizations, helping people and righting wrongs. The first series features Christopher Eccleston as the ninth incarnation of the Doctor, his only series as the Doctor, accompanied by Billie Piper, as his first and main companion Rose Tyler, whom he plucks from obscurity on planet Earth, and to whom he grows increasingly attached. He also travels briefly with unruly boy-genius Adam Mitchell, played by Bruno Langley, and with 51st-century con man and former 'Time Agent' Captain Jack Harkness, portrayed by John Barrowman. Episodes in series one form a loose story arc, based upon the recurring phrase \\\"Bad Wolf\\\", the significance of which goes unexplained until the two-part series finale.\",\"images\":{\"poster\":{\"full\":\"https:\/\/walter.trakt.us\/images\/seasons\/000\/060\/080\/posters\/original\/94e2eafbd4.jpg?1420121609\",\"medium\":\"https:\/\/walter.trakt.us\/images\/seasons\/000\/060\/080\/posters\/medium\/94e2eafbd4.jpg?1420121609\",\"thumb\":\"https:\/\/walter.trakt.us\/images\/seasons\/000\/060\/080\/posters\/thumb\/94e2eafbd4.jpg?1420121609\"},\"thumb\":{\"full\":\"https:\/\/walter.trakt.us\/images\/seasons\/000\/060\/080\/thumbs\/original\/a9924ed8b9.jpg?1420121613\"}}},{\"number\":2,\"ids\":{\"trakt\":60081,\"tvdb\":null,\"tmdb\":58469,\"tvrage\":null},\"rating\":8.7,\"votes\":20,\"episode_count\":13,\"overview\":\"The second series of British science fiction series Doctor Who began on 25 December 2005 with the Christmas special \\\"The Christmas Invasion\\\".
